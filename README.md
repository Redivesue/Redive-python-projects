# Redive-first-python-project
A new Python Learner learning the python from 0 by myself.
This project contains the all answers to the practices of book 
<<The Python Workbook:A Brief Introduction With Exercises And Solutions,Second Edition>> written by Ben Stephenson.

# Why first try is that book?
This book explains the most basic Python knowledge, but I still think it's worth trying it out. 
It can deepen your understanding of the basics without making it too difficult for beginners to understand.

# Personal reflections and expectations
Regardless, this is my first step into learning Python programming. 
I also hope to continue smoothly on my programming journey.
### My own approximate learning path is: Python basics -> Python data analysis -> Python data scraping -> Database development -> ?

# Hope to get your guidance！
I also welcome experienced programmers to critique my work and point out any errors or imperfections in the comments. 

I sincerely hope you will generously share your feedback, offering suggestions and inspiration for improvement.

At the same time, I would also greatly appreciate any learning path suggestions from experienced programmers for my Python programming journey.
